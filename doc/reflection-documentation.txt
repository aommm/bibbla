Reflection of documentation.

Documents for the Bibbla project, were always discussed during our meetings. We would do some research to figure out what kind of information was requested, and what kind of information was common to include in documents of similar kind. We would either divide the different points in one document between some, or all of the group members, or divide different documents between us.
    Before dividing tasks etc. we would discuss the groups opinions and come to a common conclusion, to facilitate the future work and set up some kind of general idea.
    We would use the Google Drive to handle our documents. We felt that this gave every member of our group an opportunity to follow the developments of the documents and it also made all text our common property. Looking back, we are pleased with how this has worked for us, and would we redo the project again, we would once again choose to do as much documentation as possible in the Google Drive.
